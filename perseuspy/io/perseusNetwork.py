'''Note: The whole data structure for networks is represented via the list of the 5 following objects: 
		 networkTable, networkNodes = {GUID:nodeTable}, networkEdges = {GUID:edgeTable}, networkNameGUID = {Name:GUID}, networkGraph = {GUID:Graph}
		 
		 Important when changing graphs:
		 As 'writeNetworks(...)' currently  writes the networks from networkTable, networkNodes and networkEdges (not from networkGraph!),
		 networkGraph shall represent the same graphs as networkTable, networkNodes and networkEdges imply.
		 To keep this relation: When changing graph, simultaneously changing networkTables(network)
		 -> for example addEdge(), addNode(), removeEdge(), removeNode() necessary'''
